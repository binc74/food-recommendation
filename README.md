## Introduction

We noticed a lack of applications that provide
direct and convenient solution to diet plans.
Current applications often focus on either food or
restaurants, so users may spend unnecessary
time on searching restaurants and nutrients of the
food to make diet plans.

Therefore, we aim to build a convenient-used
recommendation system that helps users keep
track of diet nutrient and gives daily food
recommendations according to users’ personal
health status and goals. Currently, we support
two health options for such goals: reduce weight
and build muscle.

Our application provides 2 basic functionalities to
the user: Keeping track of their daily diet by
taking pictures of their meals and our application
will store the user’s diet history. The user could
analyze his diet history and his daily nutrition
consumption such as protein and calorie. The
other main functionality is to recommend recipes
and restaurants to the users that meets the goal
of the user, such as losing weight or building
muscle.
